## 🤖 how to intall 🤖 
you can install this app by cloning it from github via git (requires git obviously)

`git clone git@github.com:Glogzi/termcards.git [path]`

or you can just download it from github by pressing **Code** button and then **Download ZIP**

its funny cause i explained it probably for no reason since probably no one will even visit this page on github (potentionally friends will, but they know how to install github app lmao)

## ❓what is this app for❓

this app is for memorizing things\
its great for learning language's vocabulary

this app will ask you questions and you have to guess all of them in a row to complete

(questions will not appear again unless you will fail guessing one)

this app includes flashcard sets creator, but you can also create them by yourself by just puting file with extension `.flc` containing questions and answers to flcs directory

## 🔥funfact🔥
I originally made this app to study for chemistry test, first (before putting it on github) it only had flcs.py that could load only flashcard set named "flc.txt", but when i wanted to learn japanese i realised that this app will be more useful when it will be able to load many flashcard sets with different names, and when it will have flashcard sets creator, so I putted it on github and made this app better
